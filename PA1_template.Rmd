## Loading and preprocessing the data
if (!exists("activity.csv")) {
  unzip("activity.zip")
}
activity <- fread("activity.csv")


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
####sum the steps per day
####avg the sum of the steps per day
steps <- activity %>% group_by(date) %>% summarize(steptotal = sum(steps)) %>% na.omit()


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
####histogram
hist(steps$steptotal)
####Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
#### that means that ``` r thing with code hidden probably
mean(steps$steptotal)
median(steps$steptotal)
####What is the average daily activity pattern?
adap <- activity %>% group_by(interval) %>% na.omit() %>% summarize(stepint =mean(steps))

#Make a time series plot (type = "l") of #the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, #averaged across all days (y-axis)

##### plot steps over intervals???
ggplot(adap, aes(interval, stepint)) + geom_line()
#Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, #contains the maximum number of steps?
adap[which.max(adap$stepint),]


## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
